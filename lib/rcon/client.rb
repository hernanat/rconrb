module Rcon
  # Basic client for executing commands on your server remotely using the Source RCON protocol.
  # See {https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol here} for more details.
  #
  # This is intended to be flexible enough to suit the needs of various flavors of RCON (for
  # example, Minecraft).
  #
  # See individual method summaries for more information.
  class Client
    # Instantiates an {Client}.
    #
    # @param host [String] IP address of the server running RCON
    # @param port [Integer] RCON port
    # @param password [String] RCON password

    end

    # Opens a TCP socket and authenticates with RCON.
    #
    # According to the RCON spec, the server will respond to an authentication request with a
    # SERVERDATA_RESPONSE_VALUE packet, followed by a SERVERDATA_AUTH_RESPONSE packet by
    # default.
    #
    # However, this is not the case in every implementation (looking at you Minecraft). For the
    # sake of being flexible, we include a param which allows us to enable / disable this default behavior (see below).
    #
    # It is not recommended to call this method more than once before ending the session.

    # Execute the given command.
    #
    # Some commands require their responses to be sent across several packets because
    # they are larger than the maximum (default) RCON packet size of 4096 bytes.
    #
    # In order to deal with this, we send an additional "trash" packet immediately
    # following the initial command packet. SRCDS guarantees that requests are processed
    # in order, and the subsequent responses are also in order, so we use this fact to
    # append the packet bodies to the result on the client side until we see the trash
    # packet id.
    #
    # Many commands won't require a segmented response, so we disable this behavior by
    # default. You can enable it if you'd like using the option describe below.
    #
    # Additionally, some implementations of RCON servers (MINECRAFT) cannot handle two 
    # packets in quick succession, so you may want to wait a short duration (i.e. <= 1 second)
    # before sending the trash packet. We give the ability to do this using the
    # wait option described below.
    #
    # @param [Hash] opts options for executing the command
    # @option opts [Boolean] :expect_segmented_response follow segmented response logic described above if true
    # @option opts [Integer] :wait seconds to wait before sending trash packet (i.e. Minecraft ðŸ˜¡)
